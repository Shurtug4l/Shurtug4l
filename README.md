## About

I operate at the intersection of AI risk management, governance, and cybersecurity — supporting organizations in building AI systems that are secure, auditable, and compliant with regulatory frameworks.

Currently at **Deloitte Risk Advisory**, my work spans two core areas:

### AI Ethics & Trustworthy AI

- **AI Risk Management:** risk identification, assessment, and mitigation strategies for AI systems, with focus on agentic AI architectures and autonomous decision-making systems
- **AI Governance & Compliance:** alignment with EU AI Act, ISO/IEC 42001, NIST AI RMF, and emerging regulatory standards
- **Trustworthy AI Evaluations:** auditing AI systems for fairness, transparency, explainability, robustness, and accountability
- **AI Agents Risk Assessment:** analyzing risks specific to LLM-based agents, multi-agent systems, and human-in-the-loop architectures

### Cybersecurity

- **Policy Development:** drafting and reviewing cybersecurity policies, procedures, and guidelines for private enterprises and public sector entities
- **Risk Assessment:** conducting security risk assessments, gap analyses, and compliance evaluations against frameworks (ISO 27001, NIST CSF, NIS2)
- **Security Governance:** supporting clients in establishing security governance structures and incident response protocols
